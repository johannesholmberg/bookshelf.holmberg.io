- quote: "Our most persistent error as an industry has been to apply the largely incompatible principles of printed graphical communication design to the web."
  loc: 135-136

- quote: "The truth is, design work is deliberation. It’s the pursuit of the best solution to a given problem. By relegating design to the realm of visual aesthetics, so much of the web goes undesigned. This can only lead to inaccessibility, poor performance and, of course, a general lack of utility."
  loc: 140-142

- quote: "The web is made of code and must be designed, therefore designing with code is working with the right materials. This is the best course of action."
  loc: 145-146

- quote: "In any case, thinking about the structure of data and trying to arrive at an optimal solution is designing and there’s not an Adobe license or copy of Sketch in sight."
  loc: 192-194

- quote: "Though frequently omitted, declaring a language for a web page could scarcely be more important."
  loc: 316-317

- quote: "Perhaps most starkly, a page that does not have a language declared — or has the wrong language declared for the content — will not trigger the adoption of an appropriate synthetic voice profile when used with a screen reader."
  loc: 322-324

- quote: "Targeting the specific viewports of specific devices (employing device breakpoints) is an exercise in futility if you want to create a truly inclusive experience. There are just too many viewport variations available to support each one. Instead, you should create an entirely flexible design from the outset and insert breakpoints only where the content breaks the layout — hence content breakpoint or tweakpoint."
  loc: 365-368

- quote: "By employing content breakpoints, you can ensure successful layouts for a range of devices far greater than you would ever be able to manually test with."
  loc: 368-369

- quote: "As a rule of thumb, you should never set a fixed width or height on any element: the intrinsic flexibility of boxes means they can tolerate the same content in different spaces."
  loc: 379-380

- quote: "To achieve inclusive design you should act as a facilitator, allowing users to configure the way they view and interact with the content you provide them. The fewer decisions you make for them, the more they can make for themselves."
  loc: 411-412

- quote: "If you’re building a highly complex layout, a grid system may help you. However, you should not be building a highly complex layout. Simple user interfaces are usable interfaces, accessible interfaces, maintainable interfaces, and performant interfaces."
  loc: 1214-1216

- quote: "As a rule of thumb, if the menu has fewer than five items, just lay them out; make them available to the user at all times."
  loc: 3110-3111

- quote: "In desktop viewports, there’s rarely any reason to hide a navigation menu away, regardless of the number of items it contains."
  loc: 3111-3112

- quote: "Hiding functionality away from users and requiring them to perform an additional action to reveal that functionality is always a last resort."
  loc: 3112-3113

- quote: "Avoid the temptation, though, to add animations — especially ones which depend on CSS positioning — just to impress users."
  loc: 3636-3637

- quote: "Despite the inclusive nature of standard radio buttons, they offer limited styling opportunities. This is the main reason why we dispense with them in favor of either completely inaccessible <div>- and <span>-based solutions, or comparatively fragile and complex WAI-ARIA implementations."
  loc: 4748-4752

- quote: "One example of making a decision on users’ behalf is to disable zoom, using user-scalable=no on the viewport <meta> tag. This is to decide for the user what font size and magnification level suits them, and prevents them from adjusting it themselves. An audacious act, and foolhardy given the inevitable diversity of your audience."

- quote: "My current output is hardly perfect, but it has benefited from a change in mindset, an acknowledgement that web pages aren’t merely pinboards for images."
  loc: 5454-5455

- quote: "Really, web pages are terminals: they accept information (input) and display information (output)."
  loc: 5455-5456

- quote: "On the other hand, forms are a 10,000-volt electromagnet for attracting usability problems."
