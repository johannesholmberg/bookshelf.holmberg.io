- quote: "Whereas the craftsman mindset focuses on what you can offer the world, the passion mindset focuses instead on what the world can offer you. This mindset is how most people approach their working lives."

- quote: "Let’s assume you’re a knowledge worker, which is a field without a clear training philosophy. If you can figure out how to integrate deliberate practice into your own life, you have the possibility of blowing past your peers in your value, as you’ll likely be alone in your dedication to systematically getting better."

- quote: "Another deliberate-practice routine was the introduction of my hour tally—a sheet of paper I mounted behind my desk at MIT, and plan on remounting at Georgetown."
  loc: 2461

- quote: "The sheet has a row for each month on which I keep a tally of the total number of hours I’ve spent that month in a state of deliberate practice."
  loc: 2462

- quote: "By having these hour counts stare me in the face every day I’m motivated to find new ways to fit more deliberate practice into my schedule. Without this routine, my total amount of time spent stretching my abilities would undoubtedly be much lower."

- quote: "Getting better and better at what I did became what mattered most, and getting better required the strain of deliberate practice."
  loc: 2482
