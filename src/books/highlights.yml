In unhealthy cultures, sometimes these signs can take time to evolve. Before negativity becomes the norm, and the norm becomes comfort, the freshness of what’s transpiring is, in fact, your ally.

    {
      quote: "The problem most developers new to JS seem to have is that later doesn’t happen strictly and immediately after now. In other words, tasks that cannot complete now are, by definition, going to complete asynchronously, and thus we will not have blocking behavior as you might intuitively expect or want. ",

      quote: "The JS engine doesn’t run in isolation. It runs inside a hosting environment, which is for most developers the typical web browser. Over the last several years (but by no means exclusively), JS has expanded beyond the browser into other environments, such as servers, via things like Node.js. In fact, JavaScript gets embedded into all kinds of devices these days, from robots to lightbulbs. ",

      quote: "Because of JavaScript’s single-threading, the code inside of foo() (and bar()) is atomic, which means that once foo() starts running, the entirety of its code will finish before any of the code in bar() can run, or vice versa. This is called run-to-completion behavior. ",

To invoke an analogy, consider a movie: it consists of thousands upon thousands of individual pictures, and each of them makes sense and carries a meaning, yet the meaning of the whole film cannot be seen before its last sequence is shown. However, we cannot understand the whole film without having first understood each of its components, each of the individual pictures. Isn’t it the same with life? Doesn’t the final meaning of life, too, reveal itself, if at all, only at its end, on the verge of death?

An American woman once confronted me with the reproach, “How can you still write some of your books in German, Adolf Hitler’s language?” In response, I asked her if she had knives in her kitchen, and when she answered that she did, I acted dismayed and shocked, exclaiming, “How can you still use knives after so many killers have used them to stab and murder their victims?” She stopped objecting to my writing books in German",

(A special cord, called an andon, stops the assembly line and alerts the expert crew.) Experts converge upon the problem area to determine the cause. “Why did it happen?” “Why was that?” “Why is that the reason?” The philosophy is to ask “Why?” as many times as may be necessary to get to the root cause of the problem and then fix it so it can never occur again.
