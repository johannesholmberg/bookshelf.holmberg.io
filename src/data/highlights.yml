    {
      quote: "The truth is, design work is deliberation. It’s the pursuit of the best solution to a given problem. By relegating design to the realm of visual aesthetics, so much of the web goes undesigned. This can only lead to inaccessibility, poor performance and, of course, a general lack of utility.",

    {
      quote: "Targeting the specific viewports of specific devices (employing device breakpoints) is an exercise in futility if you want to create a truly inclusive experience. There are just too many viewport variations available to support each one. Instead, you should create an entirely flexible design from the outset and insert breakpoints only where the content breaks the layout — hence content breakpoint or tweakpoint.",

      quote: "As a rule of thumb, you should never set a fixed width or height on any element: the intrinsic flexibility of boxes means they can tolerate the same content in different spaces.",

    },
    {
      quote: "One example of making a decision on users’ behalf is to disable zoom, using user-scalable=no on the viewport <meta> tag. This is to decide for the user what font size and magnification level suits them, and prevents them from adjusting it themselves. An audacious act, and foolhardy given the inevitable diversity of your audience.",

      quote: "Recognizing that old age is a time of exploitation helps provide new perspectives on some of the classic phenomena of aging. For example, while going to college—a new social environment filled with people you haven’t met—is typically a positive, exciting time, going to a retirement home—a new social environment filled with people you haven’t met—can be painful. And that difference is partly the result of where we are on the explore/exploit continuum at those stages of our lives.",

When the employee finally reaches a role in which they don’t perform well, their march up the ranks will stall, and they will  remain in that role for the rest of their career.
